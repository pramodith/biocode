Write a function that takes a list of gene expression vectors and
normalizes each gene independently using z-score normalization.

Each inner list represents one gene, and each number is the geneâ€™s 
expression level in a specific sample. If a gene has zero standard 
deviation (i.e., all values are identical), return a vector of zeros for that gene. 
If the input list is empty, return an empty list.

This step is a direct pre-processing step for clustering algorithms like K-means. 
Note: Outputs assume exact arithmetic; small floating-point deviations are acceptable.
